# üïâÔ∏è Cartography on The Bhagavad Gita

A semantic and sentiment-driven exploration of the Bhagavad Gita using NLP techniques. This project extracts knowledge graphs, uncovers deep semantic patterns, and maps the relationships between characters and concepts using word embeddings, TF-IDF, BM25, and LSTM models‚Äîwithout relying on any large language models.

## üîç Project Objectives

- Scrape and preprocess the Bhagavad Gita verses.
- Perform semantic analysis using TF-IDF, BM25, and Word2Vec.
- Use LSTM for sentiment classification.
- Extract relationships between entities.
- Generate a cartographic knowledge graph of verses and concepts.

## üß† Methodology

### 1. Web Scraping
- Scrapes verses in English.
- Saves data to a structured `.csv` format.

### 2. Preprocessing
- Tokenization
- Lemmatization
- Stopword removal
- POS filtering

### 3. Semantic Analysis
- **TF-IDF** and **BM25**: Score verses for lexical similarity.
- **Word2Vec**: Trained on Bhagavad Gita to compute deep semantic closeness.

### 4. Relationship Extraction
- Entity co-occurrence and dependency parsing.
- Generate relationship triples for graph construction.

### 5. Sentiment Classification
- LSTM-based model to classify each verse into positive/negative/neutral sentiments.

### 6. Cartography (Knowledge Graph)
- Constructs a Knowledge Graph using extracted entities and sentiments.
- Maps key figures (e.g., Krishna, Arjuna) and themes (e.g., Dharma, Karma).
